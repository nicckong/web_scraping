    "    - When no topic is selected in the plot on the left, the bar chart shows the top-30 most \"salient\" terms in the corpus. A term's saliency is a measure of both how frequent the term is in the corpus and how \"distinctive\" it is in distinguishing between different topics.  \n",
    "    - When a particular topic is selected, the bar chart changes to show the top-30 most \"relevant\" terms for the selected topic. The relevance metric is controlled by the parameter λ, which can be adjusted with a slider above the bar chart.\n",
    "        - Setting the λ parameter close to 1.0 (the default) will rank the terms solely according to their probability within the topic.\n",
    "        - Setting λ close to 0.0 will rank the terms solely according to their \"distinctiveness\" or \"exclusivity\" within the topic — i.e., terms that occur only in this topic, and do not occur in other topics.\n",
    "        - Setting λ to values between 0.0 and 1.0 will result in an intermediate ranking, weighting term probability and exclusivity accordingly."
