For food on flight from Hongkong-Shanghai, it is unfortunate that there is no food menu other than a menu containing pork. Finally I got a menu of tuna sandwhich.

I selected my seat on line but when I got the counter at the airport I asked if they had anything closer to the front and the agent put me in a middle seat. I told him what would not do so the only seat I could then get was next to the last row on the plane in the aisle. Although the seat was very small and there was not a lot of leg room they actually served a meal on this 2 1/2 hour flight. And it was not bad. I had the sweet and sour chicken with rice meal which came with a fruit cup, water and a cookie. Pretty good for such a short flight.

The food menu really needs to be address and upgraded as it's honestly worse than hospital food. Plain choices and miserable portion size left us and fellow passengers we spoke with disappointed and hungry. Our flight on the way back from Phnom Penh was due to take flight at 7.05pm and yet we standing in the boarding queue for 40 mins and not one member of staff had the courtesy to announce its delay.

This allowed me to board first and have overhead space in my exit row seat with no floor storage. Now seamlessly part of Cathay it seems the service standard has dipped a little.

If anyone put their seat back, they were so close I could have kissed them on the mouth. The flight was nothing short of misery and I must say I dreaded the thought of the return flight. Fortunately in Hong Kong we changed planes were at last on a true Cathay Pacific airliner and I must say it was an excellent flight as Cathay Pacific is known for. I have flown Dragon Air before and the craft was very adequate, however, Cathay Dragon is another experience altogether. Be careful when booking not to book a Cathay Dragon Flight.. When they. comment that the comfort of the passenger is their greatest concern my party spontateously laughed out loud as nothing could be more clearly untrue. I use to think Hainan air was the worst airline in the air but now they have an equal in Cathay Dragon Air. I fly no less than 10 international flights a year and most all of them in economy and find most airlines as comfortable as can be expected.

I bought a beer and had a cup of the free soup then I went and waited outside in one of the regular places. Boarded CX 889 to YVR and then on too HKG. I try to take the 889 since I have experienced friendlier crew on this flight compare to the direct flight it's a little bit inconvenient with the stop in YVR but take the opportunity to walk around this first leg on my flight had excellent staff and the food was good, after dinner I slept. Crew change in YVR was quick and the new staff came around with hot towels and then a then drinks and meal. This crew was excellent as well, the inflight manager was a older gentleman and he took the time greeting all passenger even though the flight was full. It's a nice little touch that happen on the YVR flights even if you are not a gold member. After meal I read and relaxed. Walked around the aircraft to prevent DVT a few times during the night saw the inflight manager in the aft pantry and he offered a glass of juice. Had some turbulence over Japan when breakfast was served so had to wait with morning coffee. Arrived in HKG and went to the lounge to freshen up before CX705 to BKK. CX 705 was a A330 and it also had long haul seats which as comfortable. Had breakfast and slept a while, when I woke up I had a blanket which was a nice touch. The crew on CX705 was as excellent as the one on CX889. Have flown around the world for work 30 years and strongly believe that Cathay have the best crew and they make you feel welcome regardless of class you fly. This is something that is lacking on US airlines and even on the other Chinese airlines.

I generally don't review bad experiences, everybody has off days and I don't think posting negatively about a business is a thing you should take lightly. However for this airline I will make an exception. This is the 3rd year running we have used them to fly to da nang in Vietnam largely because there really hasn't been any competition by other direct flights until recently. Last year they overbooked the flight and as a consequence decided to split my wife and I up even though we were travelling with an infant. When I complained at check in that this wasn't the most sensible plan and perhaps they could split up another group that wasn't travelling with a child all I achieved was a 45 minute delay checking in and an embarrassing conversation at the gate where I had been told my seats would be reassigned. The person at the gate had no idea what I was talking about and we ended up rows apart as we would have done in the first place. As I said above everyone has off days but this year I decided to reserve my seats to avoid any issues as we were travelling with a 2 children, one toddler and one 6 month old. I bought and paid for the flights 8 months in advance and chose seats as close to the front of the plane as I could to make boarding and departing as easy as possible. These happened to be the very front row, number 10, which was perfect as that was the only row with a baby bassinet. I looked at the seat configuration on line and discovered in rows 10-13 they were 2+2, then the next row was 22 and everything back of here was 3+3. I called the airline to ask about this and whether these were business class seats as I explained to them I would happily pay for business class were they to offer it on this route but they assured me they did not and confirmed I had reserved seats in row 10. About 6 weeks later by pure chance I noticed in the 'my bookings section' of the Marco Polo club website that my seats were now showing as row 26. I called the Marco Polo club, at the time I was a silver tier member, they couldn't offer me any explanation as to why my seats had been reassigned but changed them back and confirmed by email that we were in row 10 once more. The day before our flight I received a missed call and voicemail message from an unknown number. The voicemail was largely inaudible but I made out the words 'dragonair' so I gave them a call. I was informed they had to switch aeroplanes and due to a different seat configuration I would no longer be in a row with a baby bassinet. I asked what row they had moved me to and I was informed 46. I asked why I wasn't just assigned the corresponding seats on the new aircraft as they could see I had 2 children one of whom is a babe in arms but they blamed the airport and said it was out of their hands. 2 hours of complaining later I was told by a manager We had seats all together in row 26, 4 rows back from the front of the plane. Grovelling apologies were offered and I accepted that aircraft need to be changed and they had done their best to accommodate me. Next morning at check in we were handed boarding passes for row 38. I admit at this point I lost my temper, especially when I was told that basically despite the 2 hour phone call, the 3 separate confirmations of a confirmed seat and the assurances of a supervisor, we had been bumped backwards because higher tiered club members were being assigned seats at the front and my tier level had by this point slipped back down to green. Another 45 minutes wasted at check in arguing and I gave up. I am a great believer in voting with my feet and that's what I intend to do. The icing on the cake however was to come when we boarded only to discover that they hadn't changed the aircraft, the seating configuration was identical to the one we had originally reserved the seats with the bassinet in and no one in these rows had so much as a teenager with them let alone a baby. Had they told me from the get go that the first 10 rows had priority for higher tiered members and I was likely to be moved I would gladly have accepted a seat in a row where confirmed and reserved mean just that. I also do not appreciate being lied to. I fully encourage anyone travelling to da nang to make up their own minds and please don't let this review discourage you from visiting this wonderful place either.", "scores": "", "scores_cat": ""},

As a matter of fact, Hong Kong do not even need a paper ticket! But since China has not implemented the paperless ticket part and still insist on killing the trees, we have no choice. To my surprise when I arrived at Xiamen Airport, there was a long queue, first at the customs, and then at the check-in counter. I headed for the machines only to find out that the machine only accepts China ID. The staff was nice to tell me that those machines will not work unless you have a China ID. So it is an International flight with International passengers right? So we need a China ID to use the machine even if we had done online check-in? So where is the online check-in queue? NONE! You will have to queue in the regular queue which took 30mins. I do not understand why do they even implement a online check-in (which purpose is to reduce the numbers of people waiting in the queue at the check-in counter)? This is not the last of the problems.

Seeing herself incapable of doing the task in the first attempt she got frustrated (maybe she already fought with somebody). She called her fellow colleague to keep the luggage. A new lady came and stepped up the chair and kept the luggage, but after this, she literally shouted at me by making her eyes big, eyebrow stretched and wicked face. She said, \u2018this bag is so heavy and with improper dimensions. Next time you fly you better not use this bag\u2019. I really felt bad and low by her behavior and decided to not to travel by Dragon air ever. I have travelled to 5 countries earlier with the same cabin bag and almost every time the staff of other airline helped me with my baggage. The dramatic scene created by Dragon air hostess I could never forget and that\u2019s why decided to not choose it for my air journey.", "scores": "", "scores_cat": ""},
